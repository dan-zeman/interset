Interface:
* FeatureStructure has new methods to remove the value of a feature:
  generic clear($feature) and specific for each feature, e.g. clear_pos().
  Until now the only method was to set the empty value ('').

Fixes:
* Improved documentation of FeatureStructure::get_ufeatures() and add_ufeatures()
  (these are methods, not static functions!)

Fixes:
* Fixed bug in get_ufeatures(): Foreign=Foreign (was mistakenly Foreign=Yes).
* Removed the FeatureStructure::is_valid() method. It is not needed since 2.019

Interface:
* FeatureStructure::set($feature, $value) now dies if either the feature or the value is unknown.
* Default setters (e.g. set_gender()) now call set($feature, $value), so they can take multivalues

* Default getters (e.g. gender()) now always return scalars. Multivalues are joined by vertical bars.
  This is the same behavior as with the get_joined($feature) method.
* Exception: The 'other' feature can still contain anything (usually a hash reference)
  and its getter ($fs->other()) will return exactly that anything, not necessarily a scalar.

2.001     2014-06-13 17:56:05+02:00 Europe/Prague

Complete rewrite of Interset. The old Perl interface was not object-oriented.
The modules resided under the “tagset” namespace (yes, all lowercase). The new
modules are object-oriented (using Moose) and the new namespace is Lingua::
Interset. And it is available at the CPAN.

There are the following modules:
* Lingua::Interset
* Lingua::Interset::FeatureStructure
* Lingua::Interset::Tagset
* Lingua::Interset::OldTagsetDriver
* Lingua::Interset::Trie

Drivers:
* Initially, only the 'en::penn' driver has been ported to Interset 2 (see the
  module Lingua::Interset::EN::Penn). The other drivers will be ported
  gradually. In the meantime, the old implementations (tagset::*) can be
  accessed through a wrapper class, Lingua::Interset::OldTagsetDriver.
  (The wrapper is shipped together with Interset 2 but the old drivers are not.
  They are still downloadable from the Interset wiki.)

Feature changes:
* Several new features were split from the subpos feature: nountype, adjtype,
  verbtype and conjtype. This is a logical extension of the previously created
  prontype, advtype etc.
* The features tense and subtense have been merged. Their separation in the
  early years of Interset was driven by problems with encoding tagsets that
  lacked specialized tenses; later on however, Interset got the algorithms for
  strict encoding and feature replacement. Now there are other features whose
  values form a hierarchy, so it seems logical to treat tenses the same way.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interset 2 (above) is distributed through the CPAN as Lingua::Interset and its
versions are tracked rigorously. Versions < 2 vere numbered less rigorously and
there were fewer official releases. (Though internally, I was using Subversion
since fall 2007 to spring 2014, and there are SVN revision numbers.)

As many other projects, Interset has gone through its “Dark Age” when it was
not yet clear whether it would eventually be published. There was no
distinction between versions and releases, and versions were not numbered
anyway. However, there were some milestones, which are described below and
which I have numbered for convenience.



1.2

27 June 2011. New drivers: Prague Spoken Corpus (Pražský mluvený korpus, PMK)
long and short tags (cs::pmkdl and cs::pmkkr). Arabic CoNLL 2007 slightly
differs from CoNLL 2006, so there is now ar::conll2007.

New test: For all tags in all drivers now must hold that deleting the value of
the other feature does not lead to an unknown tag. This should greatly improve
chances of finding permitted feature combinations when converting from one
tagset to another.

New usage: Interset in Treex (TectoMT).



1.1

8 September 2009. Three new incarnations of Czech, English and German CoNLL
tagsets, reflecting the 2009 changes in format. Most interestingly, German
tags now contain morphosyntactic features. Thanks to Saša Rosen, who tries to
use DZ Interset together with a multi-language parallel corpus called
Intercorp, we also created a driver for the IPI PAN Polish corpus, which in
turn caused one systemic change: o-tags (those setting the other feature) can
now be ignored when the driver is scanning the possible feature-value
combinations. And there is a new web interface to DZ Interset.



1.0

February 2009. Petr Pořízka and Markus Schäfer used DZ Interset in MorphCon, a
GUI tool for conversion of Czech morphological tags. They wrote a driver for
the Czech ajka tagset (a morphological analyzer from Masaryk University, Brno).
MorphCon has been presented at a bohemistic conference in Brno (see
References). Dan added a driver for the Czech tags of the Multext East
multilingual corpus.

Various maintenance changes took place, too. Version control has been migrated
to network-accessible (though not publicly accessible) SVN repository, together
with Trac project management interface. Website now includes information on
licensing, references and this version history. From now on, I intend to
distinguish revisions from numbered releases.



0.5

May 2008. DZ Interset was first presented at the Language Resoruces and
Evaluation Conference (LREC) in Marrakech, Morocco (see References). At that
time, new drivers for the German Stuttgart-Tübingen Tagset and the Portuguese
Floresta/CoNLL tagset (extremly noisy, huh!) were present.

At the time around LREC, a major change in the feature pool started to
crystallize. The diametrically different approaches to tagging of pronouns and
determiners led me to remove these categories from the top-level part-of-speech
set and transform them to special cases of nouns and adjectives. Such approach
had already been taken a year before for Bulgarian but now I wanted to unify it
across languages. In the end of 2008, all drivers already reflected the changed
policy. The state of pronouns may further change in future, as this is a rather
controversial issue. On the other hand, a similar change may be needed for
numerals, too.



0.2

Spring 2007. I struggled to convert tagsets of several CoNLL shared task
treebanks in order to improve the accuracy of a parser that relied on
understanding the information in the tags. It became apparent how big the
differences between various tagging approaches are. Also, some corpora
contained tags that were noisy or not very well defined. Arabic, Bulgarian,
Chinese, Czech and English CoNLL tagsets were added (Czech and English are just
reformatted PDT and Penn tags, respectively).



0.1

Summer 2006. My first unified approach to conversions among the Prague
Dependency Treebank tagset, Penn TreeBank tagset, Swedish Mamba tagset (CoNLL
2006 treebank), Danish Parole tagset (CoNLL 2006 treebank), and the tagset of
the Swedish adaptation of Jan Hajič's tagger. Tag conversions were crucial part
of my experiments with cross-language parser adaptation (see References). My
thanks go to Philip Resnik for the early comments during our discussions at the
University of Maryland.
